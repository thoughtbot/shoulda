# shoulda [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/thoughtbot/shoulda.png)](http://travis-ci.org/thoughtbot/shoulda)

The shoulda gem is a meta gem with two dependencies:

* [shoulda-context](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-context)
* [shoulda-matchers](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers)

Official documentation for each gem:

* [shoulda-context](http://rubydoc.info/github/thoughtbot/shoulda-context/master/frames)
* [shoulda-matchers](http://rubydoc.info/github/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers/master/frames)

The following describes different use cases and combinations.

rspec with shoulda-matchers
---------------------------

This is what thoughtbot currently does. We write tests like:

    describe Post do
      it { should belong_to(:user) }
      it { should validate_presence_of(:title) }
    end

The belong_to and validate_presence_of methods are the matchers.
All matchers are Rails 3-specific.

Add rspec-rails and shoulda-matchers to the project's Gemfile:

    group :test do
      gem 'rspec-rails'
      gem 'shoulda-matchers'
    end

test/unit with shoulda
----------------------

For the folks who prefer Test::Unit, they'd write tests like:

    class UserTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
      should have_many(:posts)
      should_not allow_value("blah").for(:email)
    end

The have_many and allow_value methods are the same kind of matchers
seen in the RSpec example. They come from the shoulda-matchers gem.

Add shoulda to the project's Gemfile:

    group :test do
      gem 'shoulda'
    end

test/unit with shoulda-context
------------------------------

If you're not testing a Rails project or don't want to use the matchers,
you can use shoulda-context independently to write tests like:

    class CalculatorTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
      context "a calculator" do
        setup do
          @calculator = Calculator.new
        end

        should "add two numbers for the sum" do
          assert_equal 4, @calculator.sum(2, 2)
        end

        should "multiply two numbers for the product" do
          assert_equal 10, @calculator.product(2, 5)
        end
      end
    end

Add shoulda-context to the project's Gemfile:

    group :test do
      gem 'shoulda-context'
    end
